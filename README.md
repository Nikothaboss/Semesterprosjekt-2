## Goal

To take the skills learned so far and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidate's general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Description

In this project I created a e-commerce for a fictional buisness called GameZone with both a customer side and admin side.

In the customer side you can find products and add them to cart. 

On the admin side you will also be able to edit, create and delete products.
